## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Chaoqi Chen. Now, I'm an Assistant Professor (Hundred Talents Program) at Shenzhen University.

## Bio

Dr. Chen is an Assistant Professor under the "Hundred Talents Program" at the School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University. He obtained his PhD in Computer Science from The University of Hong Kong in May 2024, and earned his Master's and Bachelor's degrees from Xiamen University in 2020 and 2017, respectively. In June 2024, he joined the faculty at Shenzhen University, where his research focuses on machine learning and computer vision.

Dr. Chen has long been engaged in the research fields of transfer learning, geometric deep learning, medical artificial intelligence, and the security and reliability of AI systems. Over the past five years, he has published more than 20 academic papers, with 11 as the first author in top-tier journals and conferences, including nine in CCF-A journals/conferences and two in top-tier journals rated as CAS Zone 1, such as IEEE TPAMI, NeurIPS, CVPR, ICCV, and IEEE TMI. According to Google Scholar, his first-author papers have been cited over a thousand times. He has participated in three Hong Kong Research Grants Council-funded projects and one NSFC-RGC Joint Research project. Dr. Chen also serves as a reviewer for numerous international conferences (such as NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, AAAI, ACM MM) and journals (such as TPAMI, IJCV, TIP, TNNLS, TKDE, TMM, TCSVT).
